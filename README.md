# Getting Started with Movie App

This project was developed by Julieta Parpinelli using ReactJS created with Webpack, Tailwind, Loadash, ESLint, Prettier React Router and Yarn, as package manager.

Api used is [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list)

## Project Description

This project is an app that shows users information about films. When starting the app, the user will see a Home Page that displays popular films. Users may filter movies by name. Users may also see lists of films related to certain genres. When clicking on a movie card, user will be redirected to Movie Details Page. On that same page, films related to the same genre will be offered to the user.

Also, there is a Storybook Page that displays some of the main components used. See instructions below on how to run Storybook.
